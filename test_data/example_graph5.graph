# Representation of a PW_TWTSP instance.
# First row: number of nodes.
# Following #nodes rows give nodeId, geo-location, release time
# deadline, duration and prize.
# Matrix of distances between nodes (triangle inequality holds).

# This instance is for testing. There is only one optimal tour
# leading to a total prize of 8. Since all locations are far
from location 3. The tour will only visit location 3 that
yields a higher prize than the sum of all others
# v_2(3) --> v_1(8) --> v_4(14) --> v_3(21).
